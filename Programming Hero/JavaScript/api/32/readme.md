1. you have an odd array (array with odd numbers).[1,3,5,7,9].
now convert this array into an even array (array with even numbers).[2,4,6,8,10] Do this using for loop & array.map() method.. Hints: add one to any odd numbers and it will become an even number;

2. you are given an array say:[33,50,79,78,90,101,30];
return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using array.filter() method;

3. now do some task of question 2.. but do this using array.find method.then compare the output of question 2 & question 3.

<!-- reduce -->
1.you have an array [1,9,17,22]. Add the all elements of this array and give output . Do this using for loop & array.reduce() method

<!-- reduce practice -->
const people = [
    {name:"meena",age:20}
    {name:"Rina",age:15}
    {name:"suchorita",age:22}
];

1.chalenging follow above array of objects .So,you have 3 objects as array element.Can you find out the total sum form here? 
20+ 15 + 22 = 57. the output will be 57;

what are you thinking > yeah! do it with for loop . I know you can do it.
but!wait !! wait!! do this same task using array.reduce() method

<!-- Access Object values -->
let data = {
    location : [{
        latitude: '34.5,37.8',
        longitude:'98.77,58.7',
        city:'Hyderbad',
        country:'India',}
    ]
};

conslole log vale of city?
